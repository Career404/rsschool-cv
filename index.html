                <h3>About me</h3>
                
                <div>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Zhukov Dmitry, I was born and raised in Moscow,
                    Russia, and recently moved to Yerevan with my wife due to job
                    opportunity she recieved. </p>
                    
                    <p>Early in my life I made an uneducated decision to pursue a career
                    of a doctor. As an entry step to this profession I graduated from
                    a medical college with a nursing degree. After that I served as a
                    conscript in a largest military hospital of the national guard forces,
                    unfortunately losing faith in my career choice due to the state of
                    public health institutions in Russia.</p>
                    
                    <p>My next job was health-related nonetheless - I became a lab
                    assistant in a private IVF Clinic. I learned laboratory techniques,
                    mostly those related to assisted reproduction, worked with biological
                    material and acquired a lot of experience developing and maintaining
                    tremendously large patient databases via Microsoft Excel and a
                    certain 1C-based system. I also created monthly and yearly reports,
                    including reports for Russian Association for Human Reproduction,
                    kept track of medical supplies, maintained lab equipment, took care
                    of all the paperwork in the lab, occasionally worked as an operating
                    nurse and in rare occasions consulted patients on lab techniques.</p>
                    
                    <p>After 4.5 years of this "generalist" role I moved to a different country.
                    I am now certain about altering my career path towards IT, and front-end development to be precise. Creating eye-catching web-sites
                    to accentuate beatiful content and practical web-applications for
                    lifestyle and entertainment is fun!</p>
